## About the Project

<img src="/src/components/images/bluelockss.png" alt="Logo">

This Website was built as part of a class Mission Project with a focus of using a Listing Website Wireframe. 

I created this by referencing an Anime that I have enjoyed that has to do with sports named Blue Lock. What I was aiming to do was create a database for the fictional characters that were chosen to participate in the project.

Although my whole dream isn't completed yet, this has the begginnings of what can be done for the site.
